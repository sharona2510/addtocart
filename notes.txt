we can manipulate a html file using js(i.e. the backend)
this comes in the dom (document object model) 
using dom, you can create a class in html and
manipulate and loop the rest in js

why this is used?
because when there are a large amount of data,
it becomes difficult to create base for each and ever data
and it takes much space and slowdown the execution of the base html file
to make the code fast and efficient, js is used 

to manipulate this data 3 functions are used
the function flow is as follows:
       -document.getElementById('container name')
       -containername.forEach(()=>{here the loop codes are initiated})
       -document.createElement('tag(div,p,h1,etc..)')
       -containername.classList.add('classname')
       -variable name.appendChild(classname)
